# Payment_System
A payment system development project in which I participated. This repository contains only my part of the code, not the complete web application.
The project was built on a microservice architecture, Spring was used as a framework, and AWS was planned to be used as hosting. Worked on the Backend part of the project, including communication with the mysql database (systable) and internal api (api/processor; processor/api). I worked on this project as a team.
